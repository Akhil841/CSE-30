Deterministic finite state automaton (DFA) is a way of representing or detecting a language.
- Example: set of string patterns(e.g. "HA") accepted or rejected on input

Used in

CSE 105
CSE 140
CSE 131
CSE 123

Circle and Arc representation and a DFA Type: Mealy Machine

States: (Circle) Remembers what we have seen so far in the input
- one of which is the start state (initial)
- one of which is the end state (we are done)

State Transitions: NExt inout determines transition to a next state

Arcs represent the transition to next state for each (and every) valid input and may have an optional
action

Label the arrow ith input/action

Refine the DFA to define responses on all possible inputs at each state

Make sure the next state transition is (arc) is unambiguous

Say you want to translate the entire contents of a text file, from the top (TOF) to the bottom (EOF)

To adjust the DFA to act on continuous input (multiple instances of the pattern) "redirect" the arc(s) 
that point to the end state to point back at the start state
