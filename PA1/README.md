# CSE 30 PA1

This assignment was to make a simple C preprocessor that removes all comments from
a C program using a DFA, preserving newlines, and replacing commented text with a single space.

I'm pretty sure this program works. (Fun fact: I ran `omit.c` on itself, and the result behaves identically to it!)
