/*
 * del_ticket
 *      remove ticket (summons) from the database
 *      look up the summons for a vehicle and pay it (remove the ticket) 
 *
 *      Find the vehicle by the state and plate. if not found return -1
 *
 *      convert the summ string to a long long int using
 *      using strtosumid. This long long int is how the summons number
 *      is stored in the database in struct ticket.
 *      After being converted you can use it find a summons id match
 *      in the linked list of tickets attached to the strcut vehicle.      
 *
 *      After you have the vehicle, find the summons on the ticket chain
 *      that matches the converted summons string (summid in the example)
 *      example:
 *        unsigned long long summid
 *        if (strtosumid(summ, &summid, argv) != 0)
 *           return -1;
 *        now search the ticket chain to find that summons
 *        struct ticket *tptr;
 *        if (tptr->summons == summid)
 *          found it
 *           
 *      If found, delete it from the ticket chain. If the vehicle
 *      no longer has any tickets, then remove the vehicle from the hash chain
 *      Otherwise you must update the tot_fine and cnt_tickets fields in
 *      the struct vehicle so the are accurate after removing the summons
 *      Make sure to delete all space that malloc()'d 
 *
 * Inputs:
 *  hashtab pointer to hashtable (pointer to an array of pointers)
 *  tabsz   number of elements in the hash table
 *  fineTab table mapping fine code to description and fine   
 *  plate   plate id string to be found
 *  state   state id string to be found
 *  summ    summon id string to be found
 *  argv    for error printing
 *
 * returns 0 if ok -1 if not found or error
